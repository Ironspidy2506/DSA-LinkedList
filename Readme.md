# 🔗 Linked List 

Welcome to the **Linked List in Java** repository! 🎉 This project demonstrates the implementation of **Singly Linked Lists** and **Doubly Linked Lists** in Java. It's perfect for those who want to understand how linked lists work and also solve some questions to test their understanding.

## 🔍 Introduction

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) points to the next, making it dynamic and flexible. In this project, we explore two types of linked lists:

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points only to the next node. 🔗
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and the previous node. 🔄

Linked lists are great for understanding memory management and pointers. 🧠💡

## 🔗 Singly Linked List

In a **Singly Linked List**, each node contains:
- `data`: The actual value or data the node holds. 📦
- `next`: A pointer/reference to the next node in the list. ➡️

### 🛠️ Singly Linked List Operations

1. **Insert at the Beginning** : Adds a new node at the start of the list.
2. **Insert at the End** : Adds a new node at the end of the list.
3. **Insert After a Specific Node** : Inserts a new node after a specific node.
4. **Delete from Beginning** : Removes a node from beginning of the list.
5. **Delete from End** : Removes a node from end of the list.
6. **Delete a Node at any Position** : Removes a node from any position of the list.
7. **Search a Node** : Finds a node with a given value.
8. **Print the List** : Displays the entire linked list.


## 🔗 Doubly Linked List

A **Doubly Linked List** has each node containing:
- `data`: The value stored in the node. 📦
- `next`: A pointer/reference to the next node in the list. ➡️
- `prev`: A pointer/reference to the previous node. ⬅️

This allows for easier traversal in both directions. 🔄

### 🛠️ Doubly Linked List Operations

1. **Insert at the Beginning** : Adds a new node at the start of the list.
2. **Insert at the End** : Adds a new node at the end of the list.
3. **Insert After a Specific Node** : Inserts a new node after a specific node.
4. **Delete from Beginning** : Removes a node from beginning of the list.
5. **Delete from End** : Removes a node from end of the list.
6. **Delete a Node at any Position** : Removes a node from any position of the list.
7. **Search a Node** : Finds a node with a given value.
8. **Print the List** : Displays the entire linked list.
9. **Traverse in Reverse** : Traverse the list backwards using the `prev` pointer.
